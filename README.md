# Dagger Fundamentals

This is tutorial to illustrate the different features of the Dagger 2 Dependency Injection framework.

I created this in a previous job and thought it would be good to share it with everyone.

Orginally the project was intended for Android developers but I have changed it to a pure kotlin project. It will work with IntelliJ IDEA community edition.

Each package shows a different aspect of the SDK and will have a markdown file which will explain and summarise the key concepts.


## Disclaimers:

* The illustration code won't actually do anything apart from occasional println(). You will be required to use your imagination somewhat. The focus  is on Dagger concepts rather than a fully functioning app.

* Some knowledge of Dependency Injection, JVM annotations and annotation processing is assumed
